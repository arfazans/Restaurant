      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <!-- <div class="divider"></div> -->
      <p>At Ember & Sage, we believe that exceptional cuisine begins with a story. Founded in 2018 by Chef Miranda Chen,
        our journey started in a small kitchen with big dreams and a passion for transforming locally-sourced
        ingredients into unforgettable culinary experiences.
        Each dish we create is a canvasâ€”a thoughtful blend of traditional techniques and innovative approaches. We honor
        the heritage of classic recipes while embracing the creative possibilities of modern gastronomy. Our ingredients
        are carefully selected from local farmers and artisans who share our commitment to sustainability and ethical
        practices.
